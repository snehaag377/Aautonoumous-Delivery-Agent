Delivery Agent Simulation
A comprehensive pathfinding simulation with multiple search algorithms and Pygame visualization. This project demonstrates various AI search techniques for package delivery in different terrain environments.

Features
üó∫Ô∏è Map Types
Small Map (5x5): Simple grid with basic obstacles

Medium Map (10x10): Varied terrain patterns and obstacles

Large Map (15x15): Complex maze-like structure

Dynamic Map: Moving obstacles that change positions

üîç Search Algorithms
BFS (Breadth-First Search): Finds shortest path by steps

UCS (Uniform Cost Search): Finds lowest-cost path

A* (A-Star Search): Most efficient with heuristic guidance

Replan: Adaptive algorithm for dynamic environments

üéÆ Visualization
Real-time path animation

Color-coded terrain types

Dynamic obstacle movement

Cost display on each cell

Step-by-step execution tracking

Installation
Prerequisites

Algorithm Comparison
BFS (Breadth-First Search)
Pros: Guarantees shortest path by steps

Cons: Ignores terrain costs

Best for: Simple grids without cost considerations

UCS (Uniform Cost Search)
Pros: Finds lowest-cost path

Cons: Slower than BFS

Best for: Cost-sensitive applications

A* (A-Star Search)
Pros: Most efficient, combines cost + heuristic

Cons: Requires admissible heuristic

Best for: Most practical applications

Replan (Hill Climbing)
Pros: Adapts to changing environments

Cons: May not find optimal solution

Best for: Dynamic obstacle scenarios
